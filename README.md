# C99Compiler

**C99 Compiler** developed for the course **CS432**  
Department of Computer Science, University of Tripoli — Tripoli, Libya

## Project Overview

This project implements a compiler for a subset of the C99 programming language. It is designed as an educational tool and reference for students enrolled in the semester-long CS432 compiler course. The goal is to guide students through the process of building a simplified compiler focusing on core compiler components.

---

## Features

The compiler covers the **front end** stages, including:  
- **Lexical Analysis** (Lexer)  
- **Syntax Analysis** (Parser)  
- **Semantic Analysis**  
- **Intermediate Code Generation** (using Three-Address Code, 3AC)  

---

## Development Environment

- Developed and tested on **Linux Ubuntu 24**, and a *makefile* is provided for recompilation. 
  *(Alternatively, Windows users can utilize Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for compatibility)*

---

## Requirements

To compile and build the project, ensure the following tools and versions are installed:

- **Bison** 3.8.2  
- **Flex** 2.6.4  
- **GCC** 13.3.0  

---
## 3AC Syntax

- A pdf file showing the syntax of 3AC code generated by the compiler is provided.
